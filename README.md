# HealthZ
Dealing with the alarming circumstances of COVID(coronavirus) an outbreak in large numbers, even after Lockdown was removed, experts suggest that social distancing needs to be used to also stay at home and work from home should be adopted as far as a person could. 

Thus, apps and innovative solutions like our app (HealthZ), which promote the same idea can help authorities make the population aware and save lives. The app has come with a Docbot to give answers to user doubts on the current situation. 

The next feature of HealthZ is to smartly count the user’s calorie intake to monitor the user’s health.
Our smart application helps you track your calorie consumption and expenditure by monitoring the number of steps you take in a day at home. So, it monitors your health even at home.
It can help people stay safe and adopt necessary precautions in some areas where there are cases that are booming also it helps stop or prevent community transmission to an extent. Our app updates our client with daily health news related to the virus. Also give necessary details to contact authorities when needed, just a push to SOS button.
Unlike other applications a user just needs to scan the food product and our application will calculate the calorie content and suggest whether the product is ideal for consumption or not.
Along with updating our clients our app has promoted reaching out to the vulnerable section of our society by adding the feature of donating through providing the daily items to the needy.
